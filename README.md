Covid-nz is a python dash app designed to plot a live total of the number of COVID-19 cases in NZ. It accesses the Johns Hopkins database of confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as the NZ Ministry of Health website for the latest data. Covid-nz is intended to be run on a Heroku instance, which deploys automatically from the master branch on Github. 

If Covid-nz is live, it can be accessed at www.covid19-cases.nz
